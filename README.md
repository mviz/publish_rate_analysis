# Analyzing the publishing rate

This project is analyzing the results from [The Research Productivity of New PhDs in Economics: The Surprisingly High Non-success of the Successful](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.28.3.205). 

The degree to which I am trying to replicate results versus trying different forms of analysis is to be determined.
